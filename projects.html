        <h2>Cenozoa: an IoT Farm Platform</h2>

        <p class=blog-copy>*record scratch* *freeze frame* Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up self-hosting my own custom built web application platform with fully integrated, specially made IoT devices.</p>
        <p class=blog-copy>Well, it all started with a desire to increase my self-sufficency and lower my environmental impact which led me to start a sustainable mini-farm. As I studied about various farming techniques, I realized something: farming is <i>a lot</i> of work. It takes daily monitoring to keep a farm running smoothly and efficiently:</p>
        <p class=blog-copy>
          <ul class=blog-unordered-list>
            <li>Keep your plants happy by properly irrigating your soil</li>
            <li>Maintain the proper temperature in the cold frames by opening and closing vents</li>
            <li>Don't allow snow to build up on your cold frames starving your cold weather plants of light</li>
            <li>Maintain the right temperature and humidity for optimal long-term storage of harvested produce</li>
            <li>Ensure efficient decomposition of your garden waste by getting your compost bin up to the proper temperature and properly modulating the moisture</li>
            <li>Let the chickens out to roam daily and put them back in the coop for safe keeping</li>
            <li>Make sure the chickens don't freeze in the winter</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class=blog-copy>My manufacturing engineering mind immediately began to wonder: how many of these tasks could be automated? There are, of course, many off-the-shelf solutions that could help: automated irrigation systems, IoT temperature monitors, even a modified internet connected garage door opener could possibly be used on a chicken coop. But these off-the-shelf solutions:</p>
        <ol class=blog-unordered-list>
          <li>Are expensive</li>
          <li>Wouldn't have a single unified platform to manage everything</li>
          <li>Have privacy concerns: where exactly is all this data going? Is it secure?</li>
          <li>Some systems just don't exist: where could I find a system that will open and close a cold frame depending on the temperature and/or the amount of snow covering the window?</li>
        </ol>
        <p class=blog-copy>As I considered this, my software engineering mind realized that I could just build my own high-tech, fully integrated system exactly to my needs. And so I did. From the hand assembled hardware and firmware, to the self-hosted web server, database and user interface, the Cenozoa IoT Farm Platform is soup to nuts custom built for me, by me.</p>
        <p class=blog-copy>Starting with a simple temperature and humidity monitoring and alerting system, this platform will grow to include custom built irrigation systems for garden beds, a temperature and moisture monitoring system for compost piles, automated temperature and light level controls for winter growing in cold frames and automated doors and heating of a chicken coop. The status of all these sensors can all be easily viewed and adjusted through one portal.</p>
        <p class=blog-copy>Curious about how it all works? Take a deeper dive:
